        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "This notebook provides interactive examples that will assist learners in using MoSDeF tools to:\n",
        "1. Initialize complex macromolecules for molecular simulation.\n",
        "2. Demonstrate how to run HOOMD-Blue simulations with these molecules.\n",
        "3. Use and inspect forcefields.\n",
        "4. Generate coarse-grained representations and run simplified models.\n",

        "1. If the output is very long, for example from the mamba command in the second cell, scrolling past the output can feel onerous. In this case, scrolling up and down in the narrow grey area between the sidebar menu and the cells can help you navigate.\n",
